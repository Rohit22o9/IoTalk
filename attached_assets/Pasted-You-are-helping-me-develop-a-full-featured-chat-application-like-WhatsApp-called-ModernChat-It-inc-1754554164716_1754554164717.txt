You are helping me develop a full-featured chat application like WhatsApp, called ModernChat. It includes personal chats, group chats, and communities. The codebase is using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and Socket.IO, with TailwindCSS for styling.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs already done:
- Login/Signup system with sessions.
- Personal chat with media sharing (image/video/doc).
- Group chat creation and messaging with multiple members.
- Communities feature to group several chats together.
- WebRTC integration for both personal and group voice calls (UI and basic functionality done).
- Chat interface styled to look like WhatsApp.

Now I want you to help me implement the following AI features in this existing app:

### üîπ 1. AI Moderation Agent (for personal, group, and community chats)
- Detect inappropriate, harmful, or illegal content.
- Detect profanity and hate speech in any message.
- Detect if media (image/video) contains violent or sensitive content.
- Automatically delete or flag such messages.

### üîπ 2. AI Summarization Agent
- When users send a large block of text or media (video/audio), provide an automatic summary of it.
- Summarize YouTube links or uploaded videos using speech-to-text and summarization models.
- Summarized messages should appear below the original message with an ‚ÄúAI Summary‚Äù label.

### üîπ 3. AI Auto-Responder
- In personal chats, allow an AI auto-responder bot to reply based on conversation context.
- In group/community chats, the AI should be able to assist when tagged (`@ModernBot`) or when someone asks a question.
- The AI should answer questions, perform sentiment analysis, and optionally generate replies in a natural tone.

### üí° Technical Preferences
- Use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT APIs or any free/affordable AI APIs where possible.
- For content moderation, use OpenAI Moderation API or free alternatives like Perspective API.
- For media analysis (image/video), use tools like Google Cloud Vision or open-source models if needed.
- For speech-to-text, use OpenAI Whisper or any free API for voice/video message processing.

### üéØ Goals
- Provide a clean and seamless user experience with real-time moderation and AI assistance.
- Keep the code modular and clean.
- Ensure performance is good even with large chats.

Please guide step-by-step what files I need to create or modify, and generate full working code for each feature with proper integration in my existing structure.
